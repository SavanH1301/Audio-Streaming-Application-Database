Minimal FD set and BCNF proof :
To prove BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form), we need to check that each table satisfies the following condition:
For every functional dependency X → Y, X must be a superkey of the table.

Let's check each table one by one:

(1) Playlist Table :: 
● Playlist_Id -> Last_Modify_time
● Playlist_Id -> Is_Collaborative
● Playlist_Id -> Access_Status
● Playlist_Id -> Playlist_Name
● Playlist_Id -> Creation_Date
● Playlist_Id -> Creator_Id

So Now , {Playlist_Id}+ = {Playlist_Id,Last_Modify_time,Is_Collaborative,Access_Status,Playlist_Name,Creator_Id,Creation_Date}
Therefore Key = Playlist_Id 
Hence it is in BCNF Normal Form .

(2) Account Table ::
● Account_Id -> Account_Status
● Account_Id -> Password
● Account_Id -> Creator_Id
● Account_Id -> Registration_Date

So Now , {Account_Id}}+ = {Account_Id,Account_Status,Password,Creator_Id,Registration_Date}
Therefore Key = Account_Id 
Hence it is in BCNF Normal Form .

(3) Usr Table :: 
● User_Id -> Pincode
● User_Id -> Address
● User_Id -> DOB
● User_Id -> Email
● User_Id -> Gender
● User_Id -> Name

So Now , {User_Id}+ = {User_Id,Pincode,Address,DOB,Email,Gender,Name}
Therefore Key = User_Id 
Hence it is in BCNF Normal Form .

(4) Subscription Table :: 
● Subscription_Id -> Amount
● Subscription_Id -> Type
● Subscription_Id -> Time_period

So Now , {Subscription_Id}+ = {Subscription_Id,Amount,Type,Time_Period}
Therefore Key = Subscription_Id 
Hence it is in BCNF Normal Form .

(5) Payment Table :: 
● Transaction_Id -> Method
● Transaction_Id -> Date
● Transaction_Id -> Time
● Transaction_Id -> Payment_Status
● Transaction_Id -> Amount
● Transaction_Id -> Payer_Id
● Transaction_Id -> Subscription_Id

So Now , {Transaction_Id}+ = {Transaction_Id,Method,Date,Time,Payment_Status,Amount,Subscription_Id,Payer_Id}
Therefore Key = Transaction_Id 
Hence it is in BCNF Normal Form .

(6) Album Table :: 
● Album_Id -> Title
● Album_Id -> Duration
